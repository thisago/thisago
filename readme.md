GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS). Read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign to understand
some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place to host FOSS projects.

Any use of the code of our projects by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
